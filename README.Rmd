The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is possibly the most famous theorem in all of statistics, being widely used in any field that wants to infer something or make predictions from gathered data. A first (simple) version of it was introduced in the eighteenth century, first by de Moivre and then later in a more refined way by Laplace, but it wasn't until around 1935 that the theorem as we know it today was published. The goal of these notes is to explain in broad terms what it says and, more importantly, what it doesn't.

Informally, the theorem states that if we take random samples of a certain distribution and then average them, the result (i.e the sample mean) will resemble a normal distribution the more samples we take.
